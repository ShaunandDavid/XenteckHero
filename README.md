If you give me one detail, I can tighten this further with no back-and-forth. Share your webhook source (Webflow form, Typeform, FB Lead Ads, GoHighLevel, or custom) and I will map the exact payload fields plus the fastest deployment option for that stack. The architecture above is already the quickest general solution.

If you want, I can also provide:
- the exact form consent copy to put under your submit button,
- a follow-up sequence (5 min, 1 hour, 24 hours) that does not feel spammy,
- and the AI reply handler logic for inbound SMS so it auto-qualifies.
